# Harness Design Studio

An offline desktop tool for designing the electrical harnesses of a spacecraft.

> **Created mainly by an AI.** Harness Design Studio was written mainly by Claude, Anthropic's AI assistant, used through Claude Code; the repository owner set the requirements and approved the decisions and releases. No other person has reviewed it independently (waived by the owner, see [`compliance/DEVIATIONS.md`](compliance/DEVIATIONS.md)), and no compliance with any standard is claimed. Check its results before relying on them.
>
> **Based in the WireViz repository.** This repository is a fork of [WireViz](https://github.com/wireviz/WireViz). Harness Design Studio is a separate, clean-room codebase inside it: no WireViz code is copied or imported (D-01 in [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md)), and WireViz is an export target (WireViz-style YAML, best effort). The original WireViz documentation is in the [repository README](../README.md#original-wireviz-readme); [`../docs/README.md`](../docs/README.md) is the index of all documents.

You describe the **units** (computer, power unit, reaction wheel ...) and the **interfaces** between them. The tool generates the harnesses (connectors, pins, wires), checks them, writes the drawings and lists, and keeps a change-controlled record of every release. A harness is the bundle of wires and connectors that joins the units; words you do not know are in the [glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md).

```
 you draw                      the tool makes                  the tool writes
 units + interfaces   ──►      harnesses: connectors,   ──►    drawings, wire lists, pinouts,
                               pins, wires, with a             BOM, test tables, labels,
                               reason for each choice          block diagram, change log
```

- **Your design is the source of truth.** Harnesses, drawings and lists are generated from it and can be regenerated at any time.
- **Offline.** It never uses the network (a test enforces this).
- **Reproducible.** The same design always produces byte-identical files, so Git diffs show real changes only.
- **Starts from the usual standards.** RS-422, RS-485 and CAN for communication, Micro-D (9 to 31 pin) for power and data, Ethernet as the alternative for high data rates, SMA for RF (what each one is: [glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md)). Other types and connectors can be added.
- **Honest about what it does not know.** Engineering values (derating, ampacity, EMC rules, approved parts; see the [glossary](docs/GLOSSARY.md)) are never invented. Until you supply them, results say *pending* or *not checked*.

Runs on **Ubuntu 24.04 or newer**. Version `0.1.0`, released by the owner with the engineering decisions still open (see [Status](#status)).

## Try it in five minutes

1. **Install** (details in [`docs/INSTALL.md`](docs/INSTALL.md)):

   ```
   sudo apt install ./harness-design-studio_<version>_amd64.deb
   harness --version
   ```

2. **Make a practice project** from the built-in example and let the tool work on it:

   ```
   harness new wheel-link --template first-steps
   harness generate wheel-link
   harness drc wheel-link
   harness export wheel-link
   ```

3. **Look at the result**: drawings and lists are in `wheel-link/outputs/`. Open the project in the app (**Harness Design Studio** in the application menu, then **File > Open project…**) to see the diagram, the *Problems* tab and the *Why is it like this?* explanation of every wire.

That is the whole idea. [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) walks through it step by step with the real output of every command.

## Examples and templates

`harness new --list` shows the example projects shipped with the tool. All five, with what to run and what you should see, are on the [examples page](docs/examples/README.md). `minimal-satellite`, `flatsat` and the `design-worksheet.md` template are on `master` and **not in the 0.1.0 packages**, which have `blank`, `first-steps` and `small-satellite`.

| Example | What it is |
| --- | --- |
| `blank` | An empty project with the starter parts and interface types. Start a real design here. |
| `first-steps` | Three units, a power link and an RS-422 link. Nothing generated yet. Start here. |
| `minimal-satellite` | Seven units, nominal only: solar array, battery, power unit, computer, radio, wheel and sun sensor. A small but realistic starting point. |
| `small-satellite` | 14 units with redundant chains. Generate it to see a realistic system. |
| `flatsat` | A complete bench: 23 flight and ground units, generated, with example numbers. Read [`docs/FLATSAT_EXAMPLE.md`](docs/FLATSAT_EXAMPLE.md) for a tour. |

`harness templates my-templates` copies templates for your own data: CSV files for interfaces, approved parts and segment lengths, a KiCad netlist, a CI script, a GitHub Actions workflow, a **design worksheet** to plan a design on paper, a design review checklist and *demo* engineering values for learning (not engineering data). What each file is for: [`src/harness_design_studio/resources/examples/templates/README.md`](src/harness_design_studio/resources/examples/templates/README.md).

## What is in a project

A project is a folder of small JSON files (`project.json`, `config/`, `library/`, `logical/`, `physical/`, ...). Put it in Git. Outputs go to `outputs/` and are always safe to delete and regenerate. Format: [`docs/FILE_FORMAT.md`](docs/FILE_FORMAT.md).

## Status

Version `0.1.0`, released by the owner on 2026-10-09 with the following still open ([`compliance/SIGNOFF.md`](compliance/SIGNOFF.md); all the records are indexed in [`compliance/README.md`](compliance/README.md)). Not supplied: the harness boundary rule (D-10), real derating and EMC values (D-11), the approved parts list (D-12), the title block (D-15). Not done and waived by the owner: independent review, usability sessions, a screen-reader pass and a clean-machine installation test ([`compliance/DEVIATIONS.md`](compliance/DEVIATIONS.md)). See [`docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md`](docs/OPEN_DECISIONS.md) and [`docs/RELEASE.md`](docs/RELEASE.md). Until the engineering values exist, results say so. `master` is ahead of the 0.1.0 packages and still reports `0.1.0`; the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md) section *Unreleased* lists the difference.
