# Design, coding and tool standards

Addresses ECSS-Q-ST-80C 5.6.1.1 to 5.6.2.3, 6.3.3.2, 6.3.3.4, 6.3.4.1 to 6.3.4.5 (gap G-06). These standards already exist as practice in `CLAUDE.md`, `pyproject.toml` and the CI workflow; this document makes them one mandatory list.

## Tools and environment

| Item | Choice | Where fixed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Language | Python 3.12 or newer | `pyproject.toml` |
| GUI toolkit | PySide6 (LGPL) | `pyproject.toml`, `docs/DECISIONS.md` |
| Data model | pydantic v2, strict, immutable | `core/model` |
| Tests | pytest, hypothesis; 90 % branch and statement coverage on `core` | `pyproject.toml` |
| Static checks | ruff (E, F, W, I, B, UP, SIM, S), `mypy --strict` | `pyproject.toml` |
| Build | pinned versions, reproducible wheel, PyInstaller package, `.deb` | `tools/check_reproducible.py`, `tools/build_deb.py` |
| Platform | Ubuntu 24.04 and newer | D-127 |
| CI | `.github/workflows/harness-ci.yml` (at the repository root) | |

Suitability (5.6.1.2, 5.6.2.2): chosen because they are permissive or LGPL licensed, run offline, and allow strict static checking; every dependency is recorded with version and licence in `docs/DECISIONS.md` and the SBOM.

## Design standards (6.3.3.2, 6.3.3.4)

Mandatory: `core` does not import `gui`, `cli` or network modules (`tests/test_architecture.py`, `tests/test_offline.py`); all model changes go through commands and transactions; generation is a pure function of the design; the verifier shares no code with the generator; outputs are deterministic. Advisory: keep functions small (complexity is reported by `tools/metrics.py`; proposed limit: values above 30 are listed in each milestone report with a reason; the tool has functions above it today, see `compliance/metrics.json`).
Adherence is verified by the tests named, by `ruff`, `mypy` and by review of each diff.

## Coding standards (6.3.4.1 to 6.3.4.5)

Mandatory: `ruff format` and `ruff check` clean; `mypy --strict` clean; no `print` of design data and no design data in logs; no evaluation of data, no starting of programs and no `pickle` outside the files `tests/test_security.py` allows, no network (`tests/test_offline.py`); names, UI strings in `gui/strings.py`; tests first, a regression test with every bug fix; no invented standard values (placeholder instead). Low-level languages: none used; the whole product is Python (6.3.4.5). The security aspects of 6.3.4.1 are the `S` rules of ruff and `tests/test_security.py`.
Review with the customer (6.3.4.4): this document is sent to the owner with the other plans (open action A-05).

## Verification of correct use of the tools (5.6.1.3)

CI runs the static checks and tests on every push; a failing run blocks merging by the owner's practice, not by a technical lock (the owner decided on 2026-10-08 not to protect the branch: `../DEVIATIONS.md` T-18).
