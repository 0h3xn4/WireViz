"""Rules for drawing the links of the diagram that do not depend on Qt, so that they can be tested.

A dense diagram is readable when links are routed like a wiring diagram, not drawn as curves:

- a link leaves a unit on the edge that faces the unit at its other end (never through its box);
- the links on one edge are ordered by the height of their other ends (parallel links cross less);
- links run in right angles. The links of one unit, of one kind, between two lanes share one
  vertical **trunk** with short branches to each end, and every trunk has its own track in the gap
  between the lanes, ordered to cross as little as possible;
- a link between lanes that are not neighbours crosses the lanes in between through the free space
  between their units, not through a unit;
- links between two units of one lane run on a **spine** outside the lane;
- a selection puts the links it concerns in focus while everything else fades.

`route_links` is pure geometry: the editor gives it the end points and the room, it returns the
corner points of every link.
