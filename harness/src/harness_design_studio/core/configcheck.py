"""Check and fill in the engineering configuration (D-11).

The real derating, ampacity and EMC values will come from the program's standard later. This
module makes that handover safe: it lists exactly which values are still missing and what depends
on each, validates values when they arrive (a factor above 1 or an ampacity that falls as the
wire gets bigger is rejected with a reason), and reads an ampacity table from a CSV so nobody has
to type JSON by hand. It never supplies a number itself.
