"""Review, release and new-revision workflow.

A release needs a comment, a name, and a design that passes the gate: no verifier or rule
errors for the harness, harness plans current, every wire sized and measured, outputs that
were exported from the current design, and engineering values that a person has reviewed (no
configuration file marked as a placeholder) and parts that are approved (D-136). A release on
placeholders or with parts that are not approved is possible only with a written reason, which is
kept in the change log and the baseline (D-135). It writes a baseline (a frozen snapshot) and a change log
entry, and locks the harness (see `locks`). The only way to change it afterwards is a new
revision, which keeps the old baseline.
