"""Pin allocation for one box connector. Rules (each placement records why it was chosen):

1. Pins the user locked are never moved.
2. Signals of a twisted pair go on adjacent pins; power and return are grouped.
3. Power goes first on the connector; other signals follow after the configured gap.
4. A previous generated allocation is kept when it is still valid (small changes, small diffs).
