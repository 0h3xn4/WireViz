"""Which signal of one end connects to which signal of the other end.

Both ends carry the same interface type, each from its own point of view: an `out` signal of one
end goes to the matching `in` signal of the other (TX+ to RX+, DOUT+ to DIN+); `passive` and
`bidir` signals connect to the same-named signal. Matching is by position among the type's
outs and ins, which is why the starter types list them in matching order.
