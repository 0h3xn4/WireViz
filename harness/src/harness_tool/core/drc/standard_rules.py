"""Rules that apply requirements of the supplied standards (D-131).

Each rule stays silent until its values exist (a standard profile, or the engineer's own numbers)
and the parts carry the ratings it needs; `unchecked` then says what was not checked, so silence
never looks like a pass. Part ratings are keys of `Part.ratings`:

  rated_voltage_v, dielectric_withstand_v   connector and wire working-voltage limits
  max_temp_c                                maximum rated temperature
  mating_cycles                             rated mating and de-mating cycles of a connector
  shield_insulated, conductive_finish       1 for yes (wire shield sheath, connector finish)

Requirement IDs are in compliance/requirements; each rule names the ones it serves.
