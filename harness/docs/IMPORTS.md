# Importing outside data

Everything is previewed row by row and applied as one undo step (CLI: nothing is written if any row has a problem, and `--dry-run` shows the rows without changing anything).

Starting files for every import below are in the templates (`harness templates FOLDER`): `interfaces.csv`, `approved-parts.csv`, `segment-lengths.csv`, `wheel-connectors.net`, `signal-map.csv` and `ampacity-DEMO-ONLY.csv`. They are written for the `first-steps` example (`harness new DIR --template first-steps`), so you can try each one before using your own data. Walk-through: [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](GETTING_STARTED.md), parts 7 and 8.

## Interfaces (CSV or XLSX)
Editor: File > Import interfaces. Columns: id, type, from, to, redundancy (optional); headers are matched by name (`from` is also read from `from unit`, `source` or `a`; `to` from `to unit`, `destination`, `target` or `b`; the type from `interface type`, `kind` or `protocol`). The units must exist; `type` is an interface type's name or ID. Each row needs a free connector on both units that can carry the type; a row that cannot be placed says why and nothing is applied.

## File formats
CSV files may use commas, semicolons or tabs between columns (the header line decides), UTF-8 with or without a byte order mark. A number with a decimal comma must be in quotes when commas separate the columns (`"1,5"`), or the file must use semicolons; a row with more columns than the header is refused rather than cut off. At most 20,000 rows and 8 MB; XLSX files are read from the first sheet. Only regular files are read (not pipes or devices).

## Approved parts list (D-12)
`harness import-parts DIR FILE --approved A --approved Yes --pending Review --rejected X [--category connector] [--dry-run]`

- Every row needs a category (a `category` column or `--category`); a row without one is refused ("Category '(empty)' is not one of ...").
- Columns are matched by header: part ID or part number, manufacturer, description, category, specification, approval status, pin count, mass (g), mass per metre (g/m), mating part.
- **You say what the approval values mean** with `--approved`, `--pending`, `--rejected` (repeat for several values). A value in none of the lists is an error for that row. The tool never decides that something is approved.
- New parts are added; existing parts are updated with the columns that are filled in. Imported parts are no longer marked as example data.
- Parts that are used but not approved stay design rule warnings until the list marks them approved.
- A program-specific format (for example an EPPL or DCL export) can be added as a column mapping once you can show an example file.

## Engineering values (D-11)
`harness config DIR` is the hand-over checklist: which derating, grounding, test-limit and separation values are still missing, what depends on each, and which values that are set are invalid (for example a factor above 1, or an ampacity table in which a thinner wire carries more). Invalid values are also rule errors in the editor.

`harness config DIR --ampacity-csv FILE` loads the current-by-gauge table from a two-column CSV (gauge, amperes; header optional; decimal commas accepted). It is validated before anything is written. The other values are edited in `config/*.json` (see CONFIG.md); set `"placeholder": false` in a file once it is reviewed.

Until the values exist, wire gauges stay "pending", the affected checks say "not checked", and a harness cannot be released while a wire has no gauge or length. To see the machinery work first, the templates contain **demo** values (`config-demo-values/`, `ampacity-DEMO-ONLY.csv`); they are not engineering data and the files stay marked as placeholders.

## Segment lengths from a CAD or spreadsheet (D-13)
`harness import-lengths DIR FILE [--unit mm|cm|m] [--dry-run]` with columns harness ID, segment ID, length (default unit millimetres, decimal commas accepted). Run `harness generate DIR` afterwards so the wire lengths follow.

KiCad: it is used for the electronics inside each unit, so it is where each unit connector's pinout comes from. It has no harness segment lengths; those come from a plain table as above. The connector pinouts are read from a KiCad netlist with `harness import-netlist` (see `docs/KICAD.md`).
