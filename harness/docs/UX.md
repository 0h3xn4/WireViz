# UX specification (gate for M2)

Status: **approved by the owner; the Qt editor is implemented (section 12).** The prototype below was the review gate. The clickable prototype (`prototype/index.html`, open it in any browser, offline) implements the journeys below with mock data, and 33 automated browser tests (`tests/test_prototype.py`) verify that the journeys really work. Screenshots are in `docs/ux/screens/`.

This document is the contract for the editor in M2. Where the prototype and this text disagree, this text wins; tell me which is wrong.

## 1. Targets (from the spec) and how they are checked

| Target | How it will be measured |
| --- | --- |
| First-time systems engineer builds a 5-unit diagram and generates harness plans in under 15 minutes, using only in-app guidance | Timed usability test, task T1 (section 9) |
| At least 90% success on core tasks; SUS of at least 80 | Usability tests T1 to T8; SUS questionnaire |
| No core task needs the manual | Observer counts manual/glossary opens during tests (glossary and the tour are allowed, the manual is not) |
| Never lose more than the last few seconds of work | Autosave every change to a recovery journal; soak and crash-injection tests (M2 acceptance) |
| Feedback within 100 ms; progress for anything over 1 s; nothing blocks the UI | Automated timing tests on the stress project |
| WCAG 2.2 AA, colour-blind safe, keyboard only, scaling 100 to 200% | `tests/test_tokens.py` (contrast, colour-blind separation), prototype tests at 200%, manual screen-reader pass in M7 |

## 2. Personas

| | Dana, systems engineer | Sam, software engineer | Elena, harness (EE) engineer | Rui, reviewer / AIT technician |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Goal | Define units and interfaces, get a harness plan she can trust without learning pin allocation | See which buses and discretes reach which unit, with exact signal names | Own the physical truth: connectors, pins, wires, shields; release drawings | Check plans against the design; use them for continuity and isolation tests |
| Knows | The architecture, ICDs in spreadsheets | Protocols and signal names; not wire gauges | Everything physical; wants speed and control | Reads drawings; knows test procedures |
| Fears | Making a wiring mistake she cannot see | Stale or wrong documents | Tool hides or overrides her decisions | Printed sheet differs from the model |
| Mode | Guided | Guided, table view | Expert | Read-only views, outputs |
| Needs from the tool | Only valid actions; explanations; a to-do list | Search, filter, cross-highlight | Locks, overrides kept on regeneration, full detail | Revision, model hash and status on every sheet; stale warnings |

## 3. The ten journeys

Each journey lists the steps, what the tool must do to prevent mistakes, and the success criterion. "P" marks what the prototype demonstrates; the test name is in `tests/test_prototype.py`.

**J1. First run and tour (Dana).** Opens the app, sees a sample project (mini3) and a 5-step tour (palette, canvas, connecting, problems/to-do, generate) that she can skip or replay from Help. Success: she can name the next action without reading anything else. *P: `test_j1_*`.*

**J2. Build the diagram (Dana).** Adds five units from the palette (computer, power unit, wheel, star tracker, transceiver), drags them into panel A or B (zone follows position), renames them. New units never land on top of others; IDs and names validate as typed (duplicates, format); empty state says "Add your first unit from the palette on the left." Success: 5 units in under 5 minutes. *P: `test_j2_*`, `test_new_units_never_overlap_*`, `test_live_validation_of_ids`, `test_dragging_a_unit_changes_zone`.*

**J3. Connect units safely (Dana, Guided mode).** Picks an interface type, clicks the first unit (it is marked FROM), then the second. Units that cannot take that type are greyed out and say why in visible text under the unit ("No free CAN connector"), not only in a tooltip; if no unit can, the hint says so. The tool picks the connectors and marks them "Auto" until confirmed. Success: wrong connections are impossible, not just reported. *P: `test_j3_*`, `test_connect_mode_marks_source_*`.*

**J4. ICD table and import (Dana, Sam).** Switches to the table view (always in sync with the canvas), edits names, chain, current, requirement ID inline, filters by text. Imports a CSV/XLSX with column mapping and a preview that lists every row's status; nothing changes until she confirms; the import is one undo step. Success: 6 rows with 4 problems show exactly which rows fail and why. *P: `test_j4_*`, `test_import_*`.*

**J5. Redundant chain (Dana).** Selects a unit, clicks "Create redundant copy": a copy appears with mirrored names (`-R`), dashed lines and a REDUNDANT label. Where it would connect to a nominal unit (a cross-strap), a warning appears with a one-click fix ("Connect to a redundant copy of PCDU-A") or a waiver that needs a written justification. Success: two clicks produce a clean redundant chain. *P: `test_j5_*`, `test_cross_strap_fix_*`.*

**J6. Problems, to-do and Explain (Dana, Rui).** The bottom panel shows Problems (what is wrong, why it matters, how to fix, one-click fix when safe) and a to-do list ("1 unit is not connected", "2 auto-filled assignments to review", "plans out of date"), each item clickable. Every generated item has a plain-language "Explain". Success: she can reach "no problems, plans verified" by following the list alone. *P: `test_j7_*`, explain dialogs.*

**J7. Generate, verify, regenerate (Dana, Elena).** "Generate" first shows what will be created; progress is cancellable and cancelling leaves nothing behind; an independent check runs and its result and the model hash are shown. Editing the model afterwards marks the plans Outdated and blocks release. Regeneration first reports "keeps N locked pins, changes M plans" and applies nothing until confirmed. *P: `test_j10_*`, `test_regeneration_report_*`, `test_generate_can_be_cancelled_*`.*

**J8. Expert refinement (Elena).** Switches to Expert mode (data is unchanged): connectors appear on the units, ports face the gap between panels, parts are chosen from the library list, auto-filled values are confirmed, pins are locked. Only valid ports are selectable; busy or wrong-type ports say why. Success: she completes a manual connector assignment without leaving the canvas. *P: `test_j3_expert_*`, `test_j9_modes_*`.*

**J9. Software engineer: what reaches my unit? (Sam).** Searches an ID with Ctrl+K, filters the table by unit or type, selects an interface and sees its signals, both ends and requirement ID; selection highlights across canvas, table and harness list. Success: answers "which signals reach OBC-A.J01?" in under 30 seconds. *P: partly (`test_j8_command_palette`, table filter); cross-highlighting is specified in section 5 and built in M2.*

**J10. Release, change log, diff (Elena, Rui).** Releasing asks for a mandatory comment, is blocked while plans are outdated or the verifier reports errors, locks the harness (greyed controls, lock badge) and stores a baseline. Rui sees status, revision and model hash on every sheet. Success: a released plan cannot be edited by accident. *P: release dialog and locking in `test_j10_*`; diff view is specified in section 5 and built in M6.*

### Cross-cutting safety net (every journey)
- **Delete shows what else goes** (interfaces, outdated plans), Cancel is the default button, and the result is undoable (`test_j6_*`).
- **Unlimited undo/redo**; one import or one regeneration is one step.
- **Autosave** on every committed change into a recovery journal beside the project (never design data in logs or outside the project folder); after a crash the app offers "Restore the last session" with a diff of what would be recovered.
- **Newer file / corrupt file / open twice**: read-only banner, recovery view listing every problem with a "Save salvaged copy" button, "already open elsewhere" dialog (core behaviour exists since M1).

## 4. Information architecture

```
Window
├─ Header: project name · Mode [Guided|Expert] · Undo/Redo · Search/commands (Ctrl+K) · Generate · Help · More (scale, theme, panel toggles)
├─ Left: Palette ── Add a unit (templates) · Connect with (interface types, with category icon) · Import
├─ Centre: Block diagram (Select | Connect tools, zoom/fit, legend) ── zones as vertical lanes
├─ Right: Properties (unit | interface | harness | wire) ── Expert-only sections progressively disclosed
├─ Bottom tabs: Problems · To-do · Interface table · Harness plans (+ later: Outputs, Changes)
└─ Status bar: autosave state · selection · counts · model hash
```
Modes: Guided shows the logical layer only; Expert adds connectors, pins and parts. Switching never changes data (`test_j9_modes_do_not_change_data`).

Navigation rules: everything reachable by command palette; panels collapsible; below 1500 CSS px the secondary header controls move to "More", below 1150 px the Properties panel hides, below 800 px the palette hides, and when the window is under 640 px tall the bottom panel collapses to its tab bar (this is what makes 150% to 200% scaling usable, `test_panels_collapse_*`).

## 6. Interaction rules ("prevent, then explain")

1. **Only valid actions are possible.** Compatibility is computed before the click; invalid targets are greyed with the reason as visible text, an `aria-label` and a tooltip.
2. **Auto-filled values are visibly marked** (dashed amber outline + "Auto" badge) until a person confirms them; the to-do list counts them.
3. **Messages have three parts:** what is wrong, why it matters, how to fix it (with a button when the fix is safe). No codes in the headline; the rule ID is in "Details".
4. **Destructive actions** (delete, regenerate over edits, release) show their exact impact first; Cancel is the default; all are undoable except release (which is reversible only by a new revision).
5. **Free text is validated as typed** (ID format, duplicates, numbers with units) and the field keeps its value until valid; nothing is saved invalid.
6. **Long work** shows progress and a Cancel; cancelling leaves no partial result.
7. **Placeholders are loud.** Anywhere a value depends on unfilled rule configuration (e.g. wire gauge), the cell says "rules pending" and explains why, instead of showing a number.
8. **One-click fixes must make engineering sense.** The prototype review found a "fix" that made a redundant unit nominal (defeating its purpose); fixes are only offered if a reviewer would agree with them.
9. **Cross-highlighting:** selecting a wire, signal or connector highlights it in the canvas, harness list, wire list and pinout at once (M2 for canvas, table and properties; M3 onward for plans).
10. **Terminology** is fixed: *unit*, *interface*, *connector*, *pin*, *wire*, *harness*, *chain* (nominal/redundant), *plan* for the generated documents. The glossary and tooltips carry the domain terms.

## 7. Design system

Single source of truth: `src/harness_tool/gui/tokens.py` (no Qt import). The prototype and the real GUI both read it, and `tests/test_tokens.py` enforces the accessibility numbers below.

### 7.1 Colour tokens (WCAG 2.2 AA, verified by tests)
| Token | Light | Contrast on bg / surface-2 | Dark | Contrast on bg / surface-2 | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bg` | `#FFFFFF` | n/a | `#12161B` | n/a | page background |
| `surface` | `#F4F6F8` | text 15.3 | `#1B2129` | text 14.0 | panels, cards |
| `surface-2` | `#E6EAEE` | text 13.7 | `#26303B` | text 11.6 | hover, selected row, table borders |
| `border` | `#6B7686` | 4.6 / 3.8 | `#8793A3` | 5.8 / 4.3 | control and panel outlines (graphics, 3:1) |
| `text` | `#1B1F24` | 16.6 / 13.7 | `#ECEFF3` | 15.7 / 11.6 | body text |
| `text-muted` | `#4A5565` | 7.6 / 6.3 | `#B4BDC9` | 9.6 / 7.1 | secondary text |
| `primary` | `#0B5CAD` | 6.7 / 5.5 | `#6DB3F2` | 8.1 / 6.0 | actions, selection, links |
| `on-primary` | `#FFFFFF` | 6.7 on primary | `#0A1A2B` | 7.8 on primary | text on primary |
| `focus` | `#6A2FD8` | 7.0 / 5.8 | `#B79BFF` | 7.9 / 5.8 | keyboard focus ring (3 px) |
| `error` | `#B3261E` | 6.5 / 5.4 | `#FF8A80` | 8.0 / 5.9 | errors, destructive actions |
| `warning` | `#8A5200` | 6.4 / 5.3 | `#F2B04A` | 9.6 / 7.1 | warnings, outdated |
| `success` | `#1B6E3C` | 6.3 / 5.2 | `#6FD39A` | 9.9 / 7.3 | verified, OK |
| `info` | `#0B5CAD` | 6.7 / 5.5 | `#6DB3F2` | 8.1 / 6.0 | information |
| `auto-fill` | `#7A5C00` | 6.3 / 5.2 | `#E6C34D` | 10.6 / 7.8 | auto-filled, not yet reviewed (also dashed) |
| `locked` | `#4A5565` | 7.6 / 6.3 | `#B4BDC9` | 9.6 / 7.1 | locked items (also lock icon) |
| `released` | `#1B6E3C` | 6.3 / 5.2 | `#6FD39A` | 9.9 / 7.3 | released items (also lock icon) |

All text and status colours meet at least 4.5:1 on every surface; borders, focus ring and category colours meet at least 3:1 (`tests/test_tokens.py`).

### 7.2 Signal categories: colour is never the only cue
| Category | Icon | Line weight | Light | Dark | Contrast light / dark (on bg) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Power | `P` | 3.5 px | `#B83014` | `#DDFF33` | 6.1 / 15.9 |
| Data | `D` | 2 px | `#000080` | `#33FFFF` | 16.0 / 14.6 |
| Analog | `A` | 1.5 px | `#235C53` | `#9EF075` | 7.7 / 13.1 |
| RF | `R` | 2.5 px | `#9933CC` | `#E566FF` | 5.7 / 6.6 |
| Pyro | `!` | 4 px | `#5C0000` | `#F07575` | 14.4 / 6.5 |
| Discrete | `d` | 1.5 px | `#5500FF` | `#B89C14` | 7.4 / 6.7 |
| Ground | `G` | 1 px | `#3A0953` | `#46A6B9` | 15.6 / 6.4 |

Each category also has a one-letter icon in a chip on every link, a text label, and a line weight. Redundancy is a dashed line and a REDUNDANT label, never colour alone. Colours were searched, not hand-picked, to stay apart under simulated colour blindness (Machado 2009 matrices). Closest pair of category colours, in CIE76 dE (above about 20 is clearly distinguishable):

| Vision | Light: closest pair (dE) | Dark: closest pair (dE) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| normal vision | data/ground (34) | power/analog (36) |
| protanopia | data/ground (26) | analog/discrete (27) |
| deuteranopia | analog/pyro (34) | analog/discrete (26) |
| tritanopia | data/ground (25) | power/analog (24) |

An earlier hand-picked palette had a protanopia pair at dE 2.2 (indistinguishable); the test now fails below 20.

### 7.3 Typography, spacing, icons, components
- **Fonts (bundled, no CDN):** Inter (UI) and JetBrains Mono (IDs, pins, hashes), both SIL OFL. The prototype falls back to system fonts; the release bundles the files and PDF output embeds them.
- **Scale (px):** xs 11, sm 12, base 14, md 16, lg 20, xl 24. **Spacing:** 4 / 8 / 12 / 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 (4/8 px grid).
- **Icons:** Lucide (ISC) bundled as SVG; the prototype uses text chips only. Category icons are letters in chips so they survive black-and-white printing.
- **Components:** button (default, primary, danger, ghost, pressed), segmented control, text field with live validation message, select, table with sticky header and inline editing, badge (auto, locked, released, stale, ok, warn, error), problem card, to-do row, dialog (title, impact list, Cancel default, primary action), toast with Undo, progress bar with Cancel, tour card, command palette, glossary.
- **States** (always more than colour): selected (thick primary outline), hover, focus (3 px focus colour ring), error (red + text), warning (amber + icon + text), auto-filled (dashed amber + "Auto"), locked and released (lock icon + greyed controls), disabled (reduced opacity + reason in tooltip/label), outdated (amber badge + disabled release).
- **Themes:** light, dark (follows the OS by default); outputs always use the print theme. Native controls follow the theme (`color-scheme`).
- **Scaling:** UI scale 100 to 200% with automatic panel collapsing (section 4). In Qt this is application scaling plus the same collapsing rules.

## 8. Mapping to the M2 implementation (Qt)

| UX element | Qt building block |
| --- | --- |
| Canvas | `QGraphicsView` + `QGraphicsScene`, items culled when off-screen; ports and links as items; minimap as a second view |
| Table view | `QTableView` over a model that reads the same `Project`; edits become commands |
| Properties, dialogs | Widgets generated from the pydantic model fields where possible, so validation is the model's validation |
| Undo/redo, autosave | `History` from M1 plus a recovery journal |
| Problems/to-do | One model fed by DRC (M4) and the status rules; clicking selects objects through a single selection service (enables cross-highlighting) |
| Command palette | A registry of `Action` objects; menus, shortcuts and the palette all read it |
| Strings | `gui/strings.py` (already in place) |
| Tests | pytest-qt journeys mirroring `tests/test_prototype.py`; offscreen screenshots for the review step |

M2 scope: canvas editor, interface types, table view, CSV/XLSX import, properties, problems/to-do (logical rules only), command palette, autosave and recovery, tour and glossary, themes and scaling. Generation, full DRC, outputs, diff are M3 to M6 and appear in the UI only as the empty states and badges shown in the prototype.

## 9. Usability test plan (you run it; findings become priority bugs)

3 to 5 users per persona. Think-aloud, no help except what is in the app, a timer, and an observer log of every wrong click.

| Task | Persona | Success criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| T1 Build a 5-unit diagram with 4 interfaces and generate plans | Dana | Under 15 minutes, no manual |
| T2 Connect a unit that has no free connector of the type | Dana | Understands why it is greyed, finds the fix |
| T3 Create a redundant chain and clear its warnings | Dana | Clean, or a justified waiver |
| T4 Import the team's ICD CSV with 2 bad rows | Dana, Sam | Finds and understands both errors; one undo reverts |
| T5 Find every signal that reaches one connector | Sam | Under 30 seconds |
| T6 Replace an auto-chosen connector and lock a pin, then regenerate | Elena | Lock kept, report understood |
| T7 Release a harness, then change the model | Elena, Rui | Understands "outdated", cannot release stale |
| T8 Recover from a corrupt file | Elena | Salvages the rest, original untouched |

Metrics: task success (target at least 90%), time on task, wrong clicks, SUS (target at least 80), count of "I don't know what this means" remarks.

## 10. UX review log (my own walkthrough, as the process requires)

I rendered every screen and walked every journey. Found, fixed, and covered by a regression test unless marked open.

| # | Issue | Severity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | A newly added unit was placed exactly on top of an existing one | High | Fixed (`test_new_units_never_overlap_*`) |
| 2 | Hover overrode the pressed/primary button styles, making "Connect" and "Waive" unreadable | High | Fixed (`test_pressed_and_primary_*`) |
| 3 | In connect mode the chosen source unit was greyed ("cannot connect to itself"); reasons for greyed units were hover-only; no message when nothing was valid | High | Fixed: FROM marker, inline reasons, warning hint |
| 4 | The cross-strap "fix" made the redundant unit nominal, defeating its purpose | High | Fixed: "Connect to a redundant copy of X" (`test_cross_strap_fix_*`) |
| 5 | At 150 to 200% the header wrapped over most of the screen and the canvas collapsed to nothing | High | Fixed: compact header, auto-collapsing panels (`test_panels_collapse_*`) |
| 6 | Redundant copy overlapped its neighbours; links between units in the same lane drew as degenerate loops; both links entered a unit at one point | Medium | Fixed: free-slot placement, ports on the side facing the gap, offset anchors |
| 7 | Toasts covered the Problems buttons; the tour card covered the element it explained | Medium | Fixed: toasts over the canvas, tour card placed beside its target (`test_tour_card_*`) |
| 8 | Dark theme showed bright white native checkboxes | Low | Fixed (`color-scheme`) |
| 9 | Link labels can still overlap in dense diagrams; no automatic layout | Medium | **Open**: M2 needs label de-overlap and auto-layout with nudging that is remembered |
| 10 | Wire list shows only two rows in the default bottom panel height | Low | Mitigated ("Taller" button); real tab gets a split view |
| 11 | When Properties is auto-hidden (narrow window) selecting an item shows nothing | Low | **Open**: show a one-line hint with a button to open it |
| 12 | No minimap, no keyboard-only way to draw a link other than Tab and Enter on units | Medium | **Open**: M2 (minimap, arrow-key link drawing) |
| 13 | Prototype data is mock: pins, gauges and the "independent check" are simulated | Info | By design; the real verifier is M3 |

## 11. Questions for you (please answer or mark "you decide")

1. **Mode default:** should the app start in Guided for everyone (my proposal) or remember the last mode per user?
2. **Zones as lanes:** is "zone = which vertical lane the unit sits in" acceptable, or do you want free-form zones that can be named and drawn as boxes (more flexible, more UI)?
3. **One harness per interface** is only the prototype's mock rule (DECISIONS D-10). Which real rule should the "Why does this harness exist?" text describe?
4. **Cross-strap fix:** is "create a redundant copy of the nominal end" the right default, or should the first suggestion always be "waive with justification"?
5. **Unit templates** in the palette (computer, power unit, wheel, ...): which units does your organisation use most? Do you want to import your own list (CSV) in M2?
6. **Title block / drawing standard** (D-15) and whether sheet size defaults to A3.
7. **Language of the glossary:** the 10 terms in the prototype are my wording. Please correct any definition your reviewers would dispute.
8. **Prototype sign-off:** which of the open issues (9, 11, 12) block you from approving M2 implementation?

## 12. Qt editor review log (M2 implementation)

Screenshots of the real editor (offscreen render) are in `docs/ux/qt/`; the 40 journey tests are in `tests/test_gui_journeys.py`. I walked every journey and rendered every screen as the process requires. Found, fixed and covered by a test unless marked open.

| # | Issue | Severity | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Q1 | Problems cards collapsed into blank bars when several findings were listed (word-wrapped labels were squeezed instead of the panel scrolling) | High | Fixed (scrolling bodies that size to content) |
| Q2 | Units saved without positions (any M1 project) stacked in one slot | High | Fixed: deterministic auto-placement at load (`test_autoplace.py`) |
| Q3 | Selection was lost after renaming a unit | High | Fixed (`test_j2_id_validation_*`) |
| Q4 | Saving a copy to a folder that does not exist yet failed (the project lock needs the folder) | High | Fixed (`test_sample_save_as_*`) |
| Q5 | Edits and selection took 350 to 650 ms at stress size | High | Fixed to about 20 ms (select) and 100 to 125 ms (edit); see M2 demo note |
| Q6 | At 150% scale palette labels were truncated and the bottom panel was capped so the table was unusable | High | Fixed: docks scale with the UI, no height cap |
| Q7 | After a theme change the palette collapsed into overlapping slivers | Medium | Fixed (layout invalidated on rebuild) |
| Q8 | Table filter for "rs422" found nothing because the column shows "RS-422" | Medium | Fixed: the filter matches ID, name, type name and ID, units, requirement |
| Q9 | Table column widths reset on every refresh; names truncated | Medium | Fixed |
| Q10 | Link chips truncated long IDs; the Properties panel showed its message twice (deleted widgets lingered); import preview put the long status in the middle and cut off "To"; "Create redundant copy" enabled for a redundant unit; new units off-screen after selection | Medium | Fixed |
| Q11 | Interface chips can still overlap in dense diagrams | Medium | Mostly fixed in M7: labels slide along their link to free space (placement grid); a test limits overlaps on `sat15`; automatic unit layout is still lane placement |
| Q12 | The connect hint wraps and makes the toolbar jump | Low | Fixed in M7: the hint reserves two lines (`test_connect_hint_has_a_fixed_height...`) |
| Q13 | At 150% and above the legend wraps and the canvas is small | Low | Improved in M8: the bottom panel is capped at 45% of the window height and toasts use the room available. The canvas at 150% on a 1440x900 window is about 250 px high; the legend still wraps; the diagram does not scale with the UI scale (zoom and Fit do that) |
| Q14 | Properties and palette auto-hide on narrow windows without a hint | Low | Fixed in M7: a message says so once, and again when Properties is needed |
| Q15 | The canvas is not exposed to screen readers (Qt graphics items) | Medium | Partly fixed in M7: the canvas announces unit and interface counts and the selection and names the Interface table as the accessible alternative; items are still not individually exposed. A test audit (`tests/test_accessibility.py`) found and fixed unnamed fields in the release dialog and the harness tables. A manual screen-reader pass (Orca) is still needed |
| Q16 | An edit at stress size costs about 120 ms (target 100 ms); undo about 250 ms | Medium | Improved in M7: integrity results are cached per object (a generated 20,000-wire project: 110 ms to 22 ms per check). Measured now: rename about 100 ms, move about 100 ms, undo about 200 ms. Still borderline |
