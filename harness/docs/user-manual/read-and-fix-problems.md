# Read and fix problems

This page shows how to read the tool's findings (errors, warnings and notes), fix them or waive them with a reason, and run the same check from the command line.

## Before you start

- You have a project. The examples use `wheel-link` from `harness new wheel-link --template first-steps`, generated with `harness generate wheel-link` ([generate harnesses](generate-harnesses.md)).
- The tool checks the design at two speeds. **Quick checks** run on every edit (a link without a connector, a unit with no link, connectors chosen by the tool and not confirmed, a link between the nominal and the redundant chain). The **design rules** (33 of them, all listed in [`RULES.md`](../RULES.md)) run in the background a moment after you stop editing.

## 1. The three kinds of finding

| Kind | In the app it starts with | What you do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Error** | ✕ Error: | Fix it. An error cannot be waived. |
| **Warning** | ⚠ Warning: | Fix it, or **waive** it with a written reason of at least 10 characters. A waived warning stays in the report with its reason. |
| **Note** | ⓘ Info: | Information, for example "not checked because a value is still a placeholder". |

## 2. In the app

1. Open the **Problems** tab at the bottom. The tab title shows how many open errors and warnings there are, for example "Problems (10)". While the design rules run, the status line says "Design rules: checking…" and then "Design rules: all 33 rules checked."
2. Each finding is a card. It says what is wrong and why it matters. Many cards have a button that fixes it in one click. The cards have these buttons:
   - **Show** jumps to the unit, link or harness it is about.
   - A fix button, named after the fix, for example **Choose connectors automatically**, **Confirm connectors** or **Connect to a redundant copy of OBC1**.
   - **Waive…** (warnings only).
3. Three or more findings of the same kind are shown as one card with a list.
4. The **To-do** tab lists what is left to do, for example "2 auto-filled connector assignments to review". It is not the same list as the problems.
5. The Properties panel of a link has **Confirm auto-filled connectors**. Press it once you have looked at the connectors the tool chose.

Click a card or a to-do line to jump to the item.

## 3. On the command line

```
harness drc wheel-link
```

```
# Design rule check: Wheel link

Model hash: `8a25f0c99a86`. Rules run: 33.
Open: 0 error(s), 10 warning(s), 8 note(s). Waived: 0.

Placeholder configuration in use: derating, emc, generation, segmentation, segregation, titleblock. Results that depend on it are marked as not checked.
```

After that line come the lists "Warnings", "Not checked / note" and, if there are any, "Errors". Each item has a short title, the rule name in brackets, why it matters, and how to fix it. Items that serve a requirement of a standard name it ("Requirement: ESCC3901-4.4").

The exit code is 0 when there are no unwaived errors and 1 when there is at least one. Warnings and notes do not change it.

To check only that the folder is sound (no rule check):

```
harness validate wheel-link
```

```
INFO    placeholder_config: Placeholder rule configuration still in use: derating, emc, generation, segmentation, segregation, titleblock. An engineer must review these before results are trusted.
3 units, 2 interfaces, 13 connectors, 2 harnesses: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s).
```

The INFO line is normal until an engineer has reviewed the engineering values ([fill in the engineering values](fill-in-engineering-values.md)).

The command line cannot waive a finding. Waivers are made in the app.

## 4. Fix one, waive one

**An error you can make appear.** Change a value in `config/generation.json` after you generated (for example `service_loop_m` from `null` to `0.1`, inside `values`), then run the check:

```
harness drc wheel-link
```

```
Open: 1 error(s), 10 warning(s), 8 note(s). Waived: 0.
```

```
- **The model changed after the harness plans were generated. Generate again before releasing.** (`verify-mismatch.outputs_outdated.0.83e4b6`)
```

The command exits with 1. Fix: generate again.

```
harness generate wheel-link
```

```
0 added, 0 changed, 2 unchanged, 0 removed, 0 frozen (released); 0 locked pin(s) kept
2 interfaces and 6 wires checked: 0 error(s)
```

The report then shows `Open: 0 error(s), 10 warning(s), 8 note(s).` Export again (`harness export wheel-link`) if you want current outputs.

**A warning you can waive.** On a practice project the starter library's example parts give warnings such as "Part EX-MICROD-15-F is not approved yet but is used (2 place(s))".

1. In the **Problems** tab press **Waive…** on that card.
2. Type a reason, for example *Example part, practice project only*. Fewer than 10 characters are refused: "Please explain why this is acceptable (at least 10 characters)."
3. Press **Waive with justification**. The card moves to **Waived**, and the reason appears in the report.

The real way to clear a part warning is to import the approved parts list ([import data](import-data.md#approved-parts-list)).

## What the notes mean

A note like "Current and derating limits were not checked: the derating values are still placeholders" means the rule could not run because a number nobody has entered is missing. The tool says so instead of passing silently. Clear these notes by filling in the values ([fill in the engineering values](fill-in-engineering-values.md)). Do not waive them.

## Common mistakes

- **Waiving everything.** A waiver says "a person accepted this". Reviewers read the reasons. Waive only what you have judged.
- **Reading "0 errors" as "correct".** The tool checks what it has numbers for. The notes list what it did not check.
- **Using the wrong word for a waiver.** In the compliance records, "waived by the owner" means something else: the owner accepts that a process requirement is not met. See the [glossary](../GLOSSARY.md).
- **Errors after an import.** The library changed, so the plans are out of date. Generate and export again.
