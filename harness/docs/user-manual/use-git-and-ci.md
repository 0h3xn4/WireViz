# Use Git and CI

This page shows how to keep a project in Git, how to check it after a merge, and how to run the whole build in a script or on a build server (CI, continuous integration: a server that runs your checks on every push).

## Before you start

- Git is installed (`sudo apt install git`).
- A project is a **folder of small JSON files**, written in a fixed format (sorted keys, the same bytes for the same design). So two people can edit different parts and merge cleanly, and a Git diff shows only real changes. The format is in [`FILE_FORMAT.md`](../FILE_FORMAT.md).

## 1. Put a project in Git

The project folder can be a repository, or a folder inside one. Example, with a practice project:

```
mkdir gitdemo && cd gitdemo
git init -b main .
harness new design --template first-steps
git add -A
git commit -m "Start from first-steps"
```

The tool wrote a `.gitignore` inside the project (`design/.gitignore`). It ignores backup files (`*.bak`), lock files, temporary files and the recovery folders. It does not ignore `outputs/`. Decide for yourself whether the exports belong in the repository; the folder can always be made again. To leave them out, add `outputs/` to your own `.gitignore`.

Work as usual, then commit. A second generation changes nothing:

```
harness generate design
git status --short
```

```
0 added, 0 changed, 2 unchanged, 0 removed, 0 frozen (released); 0 locked pin(s) kept
2 interfaces and 6 wires checked: 0 error(s)
```

(No line from `git status`: nothing changed.) A real change shows as a real change. After setting `service_loop_m` from `null` to `0.1` in `design/config/generation.json`:

```
git diff
```

```
-    "service_loop_m": null,
+    "service_loop_m": 0.1,
```

Running `harness generate design` then also changes `design/generated/generation.json`, because the model changed.

## 2. After a merge

If Git stops on a conflict inside a project file, it leaves markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) in the file. Resolve it like any text conflict. Then let the tool check the folder:

```
harness check design
```

Before the conflict is resolved, this prints:

```
ERROR   merge_conflict: The file contains unresolved Git merge conflict markers. Resolve the conflict first. [logical/units/aocs.json]
```

and exits with 1. Other errors may follow, because the broken file could not be read (for example unknown units). After the fix:

```
INFO    placeholder_config: Placeholder rule configuration still in use: derating, emc, generation, segmentation, segregation, titleblock. An engineer must review these before results are trusted.
3 units, 2 interfaces, 13 connectors, 2 harnesses: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s).
```

`harness check` does everything `harness validate` does, and also finds merge markers and released harnesses that were edited after their release (`released_modified`).

In the app, a project that changes on disk (for example after a `git pull`) shows "Project changed on disk" with **Reload** and **Keep my version**.

## 3. Compare two checkouts

```
harness compare OLD NEW
```

lists what was added, removed and changed between two project folders, for example two checkouts of different commits. It changes nothing. Equal folders print `No differences.` An example with output is in [change a released harness](change-a-released-harness.md#compare-two-copies-of-a-project).

## 4. Run it in a script

Every `harness` command returns an exit code: **0** success, **1** the project has errors or a step is blocked, **2** a usage error or a project that cannot be read. So `&&` stops at the first problem:

```
harness validate design && harness generate design && harness drc design && harness export design
```

The templates contain a ready script. Copy the templates and run it:

```
harness templates my-templates
sh my-templates/ci/build.sh design
```

```
INFO    placeholder_config: Placeholder rule configuration still in use: derating, emc, generation, segmentation, segregation, titleblock. An engineer must review these before results are trusted.
3 units, 2 interfaces, 9 connectors, 0 harnesses: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s).
2 added, 0 changed, 0 unchanged, 0 removed, 0 frozen (released); 0 locked pin(s) kept
2 interfaces and 6 wires checked: 0 error(s)
2 interfaces and 6 wires checked: 0 error(s)
38 files written to design/outputs (model 91531b45fd2c).
2 interfaces and 6 wires checked: 0 error(s)
build ok: design/outputs
```

The script runs `check`, `generate`, `verify`, `drc` (it stops if there are unwaived errors), `export` and `verify --outputs`. It ends with `build ok`.

Importing interfaces is not part of a script: it works in the app only ([import data](import-data.md)).

## 5. Run it on a build server

`my-templates/ci/github-actions.yml` is a GitHub Actions workflow that does the same on every push. Copy it to `.github/workflows/` in your design repository. It expects the `.deb` package of the tool in the repository (under `tools/`), installs it, runs the checks and keeps `design/outputs` as a download. Change the folder name `design` and the package path to match your repository. The build server needs no network access to the tool itself, because the tool never uses the network.

This file was not run on a build server for this page. The `ci/build.sh` script was run (above).

## Other helpers

- `harness migrate design` upgrades a project saved by an older tool version (the originals are kept). On a current project it says `Already up to date.`
- `harness schema design/schemas` writes JSON Schemas of the project files, for editors that complete and check JSON. The command tells you how to use them in VS Code.
- `design-review-checklist.md` in the templates is a list for the person who releases a harness.

## Common mistakes

- **Merging by taking one side of a whole file.** Check with `harness check` afterwards.
- **Editing a released harness in an editor.** The check reports it. Start a new revision instead ([change a released harness](change-a-released-harness.md)).
- **Committing the lock file.** `.harness.lock` is ignored by the `.gitignore` the tool writes. If you copied the project without it, add the lines yourself.
- **CI fails with exit code 1 and the drc report.** There are unwaived errors. The report says which.
