# Export the outputs

This page shows how to write the drawings and lists of a design (wire lists, pinouts, parts list, test tables, labels, block diagram) into the project's `outputs` folder, and how to check that they are current.

## Before you start

- You have a generated project ([generate harnesses](generate-harnesses.md)). Export needs at least one harness.
- Everything in `outputs/` is made from the design alone. Nothing in it is typed by hand and nothing needs editing. Change the design, export again. The `outputs` folder is always safe to delete and make again.
- Placeholder values show in the outputs: gauges say `pending` and test limits say `TBD (placeholder)` until the values exist ([fill in the engineering values](fill-in-engineering-values.md)).

## 1. Export

**In the app**: open the **Harness plans** tab and press **Export outputs**. The project must be saved to a folder first. When it is done the app says "38 files written to the outputs folder (design 8a25f0c99a86)." (your numbers will differ).

**On the command line**:

```
harness export wheel-link
```

```
38 files written to wheel-link/outputs (model 8a25f0c99a86).
```

The files are checked independently before they are written. If that check fails, nothing is written and the app says "The outputs failed their independent check, so nothing was written".

## 2. What you get

This is the list for the practice project (main files; 38 in all):

```
wheel-link/outputs/
  manifest.json                  tool version, model hash, a checksum of every file
  harnesses/W001/
    drawing_A3.pdf  drawing_A4.pdf  drawing_A3_s1.svg   the harness drawing
    wirelist.csv  pinouts.csv  bom.csv  mass_length.csv  tests.csv  labels.csv
    wireviz.yaml                 a WireViz-style description (best effort)
    W001.xlsx                    all tables of the harness as an Excel workbook
  harnesses/W002/ ...            the same for each further harness
  system/
    block_diagram.pdf  block_diagram.svg      the units and their links
    harness_overview.pdf  harness_overview.svg
    bom.csv  mass_length.csv  box_pinouts.csv  mating_matrix.csv  traceability.csv
    drc_report.md  drc_findings.csv  changelog.csv  revision_report.md
    export.json  provenance.json  system.xlsx
```

| File | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `wirelist.csv` | Every wire: signal, interface, connectors, pins, gauge, part, colour, length. |
| `pinouts.csv`, `box_pinouts.csv` | Every pin of every cable connector, and of every connector on a unit, with the wire on it and whether it is spare. |
| `bom.csv` | The bill of materials ([BOM](../GLOSSARY.md)): parts and quantities, with approval status. |
| `mass_length.csv` | Wire length and mass, and what is still unknown. Totals count only what is known. |
| `tests.csv` | A continuity test for each wire and an isolation test for each wire and shield. |
| `labels.csv` | One label for each connector and two for each wire. |
| `mating_matrix.csv` | Which cable connector mates with which unit connector, with the gender of each. |
| `traceability.csv` | Which interface is carried by which wires. |
| `drc_report.md` | The same report as `harness drc`. |
| `changelog.csv`, `revision_report.md` | The change log and the history of each harness ([release a harness](release-a-harness.md)). |
| `export.json` | The whole model in one JSON file, for other tools. |
| `provenance.json` | Which tool version and which design made the outputs, the library, and every config file with its placeholder flag. |

Only the A3 drawing is also written as SVG; the A4 drawing is a PDF only. Full list and limits: [`OUTPUTS.md`](../OUTPUTS.md).

## 3. Read a file

Every file carries the tool version and a **model hash** (a short fingerprint of the design): CSV and YAML files start with a comment line, for example

```
# harness-design-studio 0.1.0 model 8a25f0c99a86
```

A program that reads the CSV must skip lines that start with `# `. A printed sheet can be traced to the exact design it came from by that hash.

The first rows of `harnesses/W002/pinouts.csv`:

```
Connector,Role,Mates with,Part,Pin,Signal,Interface,Wires,Spare
W002-P1,cable,PCDU1-J01,EX-MICROD-9-M,1,,,W002-001,no
W002-P1,cable,PCDU1-J01,EX-MICROD-9-M,2,,,W002-002,no
W002-P1,cable,PCDU1-J01,EX-MICROD-9-M,3,,,,yes
```

The drawing is a wiring diagram. The connectors are tables left and right, with every used pin and its signal. The wires run between them. In between, each cable has a block that lists its wires with the number of wires, the gauge ("pending" when undecided) and the length. A title block closes the sheet. Wire colours are drawn only if you set them ([set wire colours](set-wire-colours.md)); unset wires are grey. The wiring-diagram drawing is newer than the 0.1.0 packages (see the [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md#unreleased-after-010)); the 0.1.0 drawing is the older wire-by-wire sheet.

The title block shows the author, checker, approver and date as "-" until the harness has been reviewed and released.

## 4. Check that the outputs are current

The **Harness plans** tab shows the state: "Outputs: up to date with the design.", "Outputs: out of date, the design changed after the last export.", "Outputs: not exported yet.", "Outputs: files were changed after export." On the command line:

```
harness verify wheel-link --outputs
```

```
2 interfaces and 6 wires checked: 0 error(s)
```

After you change the design without exporting again, the same command fails (exit code 1). The first lines are:

```
error: [outputs_outdated] The model changed after the harness plans were generated. Generate again before releasing.
error: [out_stale] The outputs were made from an older version of the design.
```

It also finds files that were edited or deleted after the export (`[out_modified]`). Fix: `harness generate wheel-link` and `harness export wheel-link`.

## Common mistakes

- **"error: there are no harnesses to export; run `harness generate` first."** Generate first.
- **Editing a file in `outputs/`.** The next export overwrites it, and `harness verify --outputs` reports it as changed. Change the design instead.
- **Committing `outputs/` by accident.** The `.gitignore` the tool writes covers lock, backup and temporary files, not `outputs/`. Add `outputs/` yourself if you do not want it in Git ([use Git and CI](use-git-and-ci.md)).
- **Opening the CSV in a spreadsheet shows a first line starting with `#`.** That is the stamp. It is meant to be there.
