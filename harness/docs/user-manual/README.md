# User manual

This manual has one page for each job you do with Harness Design Studio, written as "How do I ...", with commands you can copy and the output you should see.

## The pages

1. [Draw the design](draw-the-design.md): start a project; add units; connect them; guided and expert mode; save.
2. [Redundancy and zones](redundancy-and-zones.md): the redundant copy of a unit; links between the chains; lanes.
3. [Generate harnesses](generate-harnesses.md): preview, apply and undo; the independent check; the "Why" tab; how links are grouped.
4. [Read and fix problems](read-and-fix-problems.md): errors, warnings and notes; fixes; waivers; `harness drc`.
5. [Fill in the engineering values](fill-in-engineering-values.md): `harness config`; the file shape; the gauge table; demo values; profiles.
6. [Import data](import-data.md): interfaces (app only), approved parts, segment lengths.
7. [Import KiCad pinouts](import-kicad-pinouts.md): `harness import-netlist` and fixed pins.
8. [Export the outputs](export-the-outputs.md): what each file is for; checking that it is current.
9. [Set wire colours](set-wire-colours.md): *Edit > Wire colours...* and the file setting. **Newer than the 0.1.0 packages.**
10. [Naming and title block](naming-and-title-block.md): name patterns and title block fields.
11. [Release a harness](release-a-harness.md): review, release, the gates, the change log.
12. [Change a released harness](change-a-released-harness.md): new revision, `diff`, `log`, `compare`.
13. [Use Git and CI](use-git-and-ci.md): Git habits, `harness check`, a build script, a workflow.

## How to read the pages

- **Commands** use a practice project called `wheel-link`, made with `harness new wheel-link --template first-steps`. Put your own folder where you see `wheel-link` or `DIR`. Output blocks are real output of the tool. Numbers such as the model hash (`8a25f0c99a86`) depend on the project and the tool version; yours can differ.
- **App steps** (menus, buttons, tabs) use the names that the program shows. The app cannot be run in the place where this manual was written. Its screens were driven in a test without a screen and the texts were taken from the program. Each page says so; nothing was looked at on a real screen.
- **Newer than the 0.1.0 packages.** Some things are on the `master` branch only: the examples `minimal-satellite` and `flatsat`, the wiring-diagram drawing with wire colours, *Edit > Wire colours...* and `design-worksheet.md`. They are not in the 0.1.0 `.deb` and `.tar.gz`. `harness --version` prints `0.1.0` on both. `harness new --list` shows three examples on the packages and five on a build from `master`. The [changelog](../../CHANGELOG.md#unreleased-after-010) lists what is new. Pages that use these say so.
- **No claim of compliance.** The tool was created mainly by an AI and has not been reviewed independently. Results rest on placeholders and example parts until you supply your own values. See [the status](../../README.md#status).

## If you are new

Do the 45-minute tutorial first: [`GETTING_STARTED.md`](../GETTING_STARTED.md). The route from beginner to release is in [`LEARNING_PATH.md`](../LEARNING_PATH.md). The words are in [`CONCEPTS.md`](../CONCEPTS.md) and the [glossary](../GLOSSARY.md). The app also has a built-in user guide (**F1**), the same text as [`guide/USER_GUIDE.md`](../guide/USER_GUIDE.md).

Next: [Draw the design](draw-the-design.md), [Generate harnesses](generate-harnesses.md)
