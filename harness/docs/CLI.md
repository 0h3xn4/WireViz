# Command line reference

Generated from the program by `python -m tools.gen_cli_docs`; do not edit by hand. `project` is a project folder. Run `harness COMMAND --help` for the same text in a terminal.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | success (warnings are allowed) |
| 1 | the project has errors, or a step is blocked (for example a release) |
| 2 | usage error, or a project or file that could not be read |

Every command that changes a project takes the same lock as the app, so the two never write at once. Commands that import data accept `--dry-run`: they show what they would do and change nothing.

Examples:

```
harness config my-design
harness config my-design --ampacity-csv ampacity.csv
```

### harness import-parts

Import parts with their approval status. Say what the approval values in your list mean; unknown values are rejected, never guessed.

| `file` |  |
| `--approved APPROVED` | a value of the approval column that means approved (repeat) (repeatable) |

| `--rejected REJECTED` | a value that means not approved (repeat) (repeatable) |
| `--category CATEGORY` | category for rows that have none (connector, contact, backshell, wire, sleeving, label) |
| `--dry-run` | show the preview only |

Examples:

```
harness import-parts my-design parts.csv --approved Approved --pending Review --rejected Rejected --dry-run
harness import-parts my-design connectors.xlsx --approved Yes --category connector
```

### harness import-lengths

```

### harness import-netlist

Create or update the box connectors of one unit from a KiCad netlist (the .net file the schematic editor exports, or kicad-cli sch export netlist; S-expression and XML both work). Pins get fixed signals; generation connects interfaces to the pin of the same name. See docs/KICAD.md.
