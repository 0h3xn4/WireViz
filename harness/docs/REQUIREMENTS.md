| REQ-GEN-01 | Regeneration of an unchanged project is byte-identical and produces an empty plan. | SPEC Part 2 (deterministic generation) | `tests/test_generate.py` |

| REQ-GEN-03 | Sizing, mass and lengths never guess: missing inputs are listed. | SPEC placeholders rule | `tests/test_generate_parts.py` |
| REQ-VER-01 | An independent verifier detects missing, swapped, duplicated and outdated wiring. | SPEC Part 2 (verification) | `tests/test_generate.py` |

| REQ-GUI-02 | Generate shows a preview, applies as one undo step, shows status, the independent check and Explain. | UX.md | `tests/test_gui_generate.py` |

| REQ-DRC-02 | Findings state what, why and how to fix; warnings are waivable with justification, errors are not; waivers persist and appear in the report. | SPEC Part 3 (DRC) | `tests/test_drc.py` |
| REQ-DRC-03 | A check that cannot run because of placeholders says so. | SPEC placeholders rule | `tests/test_drc.py` |

| REQ-OUT-02 | Golden-file tests for every output type on three reference projects. | PLAN M5 | `tests/test_outputs.py`, `tests/fixtures/outputs/` |

| REQ-VER-02 | Verifier v2 checks every artefact against the design; each check has a mutation test. | PLAN M5 | `tests/test_outputs.py` |
| REQ-OUT-05 | Outputs never invent numbers: undecided gauges, unknown lengths, masses and test limits are written as such. | SPEC placeholders rule | `tests/test_outputs.py` |
| REQ-CC-01 | Releasing needs a name and comment and is blocked by verifier or rule errors, stale plans or outputs, undecided gauges and unknown lengths; it writes a baseline and a change log entry. | SPEC Part 5 (change control) | `tests/test_change_control.py` |
| REQ-CC-02 | Released harnesses, the interfaces they carry and the pins they use cannot be edited or deleted; a new revision unlocks and keeps the old baseline. | SPEC Part 3 (released items locked) | `tests/test_change_control.py` |
| REQ-CC-03 | The diff of two baselines, or of the working design against a baseline, lists added, removed and changed objects exactly (property test). | PLAN M6 acceptance | `tests/test_change_control.py` |
| REQ-CC-04 | A released harness that no longer matches its baseline is reported (rule and `harness check`). | PLAN M6 | `tests/test_change_control.py` |
| REQ-CC-05 | Title blocks, change log table and revision report come from the data; the editor offers review, release, new revision, changes (marked on the diagram) and change log. | SPEC Part 3 (outputs, UX) | `tests/test_change_control.py`, `tests/test_gui_changes.py` |
| REQ-M7-01 | Every interactive control has an accessible name; text is at least 10 px at every UI scale; the canvas announces its content and the accessible alternative. | SPEC Part 3 (accessibility) | `tests/test_accessibility.py` |
| REQ-M7-02 | Random editing for thousands of steps keeps every invariant (integrity, rejected steps change nothing, save and load round trip, verifier clean after generation). | PLAN M7 soak test | `tests/test_soak.py`, `tools/soak.py` |
| REQ-M7-03 | The user guide, rule reference and configuration reference are complete and in sync with the program. | SPEC Part 5 (docs) | `tests/test_docs.py` |
| REQ-M7-04 | Ubuntu packages: `.tar.gz` with install and uninstall scripts, and a reproducible `.deb`. | D-110 | `tests/test_installers.py`, `tools/release_check.py` |
| REQ-M7-05 | The usability kit computes SUS and success correctly and prepares the task material. | UX.md section 9 | `tests/test_usability_kit.py` |
| REQ-NUM-01 | Sizing arithmetic (AWG diameter and area, ampacity derating, voltage drop) agrees with exact arithmetic and with the defining points of the AWG scale. | ECSS-Q-ST-80C 7.1.7 | `tests/test_numerics.py` |
| REQ-TRACE-01 | Every tool requirement names the file that verifies it, and the traceability report is current. | ECSS-E-ST-40C 5.8.3 | `tests/test_trace.py`, `tools/trace.py` |

| REQ-STD-02 | Standard value profiles are opt-in (`harness config --apply-profile`), cite the requirement each value comes from, fill only unset values, keep the placeholder flag, and invalid values are reported. | D-131; ECSS-Q-ST-30-11C 6.11.2, 6.32.4, 6.32.5 | `tests/test_profiles.py` |
| REQ-STD-03 | Rules from the supplied standards (connector and wire voltage, temperature margin, mating cycles, one manufacturer per connector pair, wire specification, power and return pins, bundle current) are silent until their numbers exist, say what they could not check, and cite their requirement IDs. | ECSS-Q-ST-30-11C 6.11, 6.12, 6.32; ESCC 3901 4.4 | `tests/test_standard_rules.py`, `tests/test_drc.py` |
