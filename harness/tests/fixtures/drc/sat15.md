## Warnings (20)

- **HTR1-J01, HTR1-J02 on HTR1 are identical (EX-MICROD-9-F, same keying) and could be plugged in the wrong place** (`connector-lookalike.HTR1-J01`)  
  Identical connectors on one unit can be swapped by mistake. To fix it: Use different keying or a different insert on one of them. Requirement: ECSS-Q-ST-30-11_0140054.
- **MTQ1-J01, MTQ1-J02 on MTQ1 are identical (EX-MICROD-9-F, same keying) and could be plugged in the wrong place** (`connector-lookalike.MTQ1-J01`)  
  Identical connectors on one unit can be swapped by mistake. To fix it: Use different keying or a different insert on one of them. Requirement: ECSS-Q-ST-30-11_0140054.
- **OBC1-J02, OBC1-J03, OBC1-J04 and 8 more on OBC1 are identical (EX-MICROD-31-F, same keying) and could be plugged in the wrong place** (`connector-lookalike.OBC1-J02`)  
  Identical connectors on one unit can be swapped by mistake. To fix it: Use different keying or a different insert on one of them. Requirement: ECSS-Q-ST-30-11_0140054.
- **PCDU1-J01, PCDU1-J02, PCDU1-J03 and 8 more on PCDU1 are identical (EX-MICROD-9-F, same keying) and could be plugged in the wrong place** (`connector-lookalike.PCDU1-J01`)

- **SA1-J01, SA1-J02 on SA1 are identical (EX-MICROD-9-F, same keying) and could be plugged in the wrong place** (`connector-lookalike.SA1-J01`)  
  Identical connectors on one unit can be swapped by mistake. To fix it: Use different keying or a different insert on one of them. Requirement: ECSS-Q-ST-30-11_0140054.
- **SS1-J01, SS1-J02 on SS1 are identical (EX-MICROD-9-F, same keying) and could be plugged in the wrong place** (`connector-lookalike.SS1-J01`)

- **IF-012-R connects the nominal chain to the redundant chain** (`cross-strap.IF-012-R`)  
  One unit is nominal and the other redundant. A cross-strap like this means one failure could affect both chains, so reviewers will ask about it.

## Not checked / note (28)

- **EMC class separation was not checked: the EMC rules are still a placeholder** (`unchecked-config.emc`)  
  A rule that needs a number nobody has entered cannot say anything, and silence must not look like a pass. To fix it: Ask the responsible engineer to fill in the placeholder (see docs/PLACEHOLDERS.md).
- **Shield grounding was not checked against a concept: it is still a placeholder** (`unchecked-config.grounding`)  
  A rule that needs a number nobody has entered cannot say anything, and silence must not look like a pass. To fix it: Ask the responsible engineer to fill in the placeholder (see docs/PLACEHOLDERS.md).
- **Power, signal and sensitive-analog separation was not checked: the category pairs are still a placeholder** (`unchecked-config.separation`)  
  A rule that needs a number nobody has entered cannot say anything, and silence must not look like a pass. To fix it: Ask the responsible engineer to fill in the placeholder (see docs/PLACEHOLDERS.md).
- **Spare pins were not checked: the required fraction is still a placeholder** (`unchecked-config.spare-pins`)  
  A rule that needs a number nobody has entered cannot say anything, and silence must not look like a pass. To fix it: Ask the responsible engineer to fill in the placeholder (see docs/PLACEHOLDERS.md).
