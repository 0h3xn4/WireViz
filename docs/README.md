# Documentation index

This page lists every guide in the repository, grouped by what you want to do, with one line on each. This repository holds two tools: **Harness Design Studio** (documented in `harness/`) and its upstream, **WireViz** (documented in `docs/`, `tutorial/` and `examples/`).

- Not sure where to start? Read the [repository README](../README.md), then [Install](../harness/docs/INSTALL.md) and [Getting started](../harness/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md).
- Looking for something that was in the old `docs/README.md`? That file was the WireViz README. It is now part of the [repository README](../README.md#original-wireviz-readme), and an untouched copy is in [`upstream/README.upstream.md`](upstream/README.upstream.md).

## Getting started

| Page | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| [Repository README](../README.md) | What the tool is, a quick start of seven commands, and the way to every other page |
| [Tool README](../harness/README.md) | The same for the `harness/` folder, with the status of the tool |
| [Install](../harness/docs/INSTALL.md) | Check your system, install the `.deb`, the `.tar.gz` or run from source, check that it works |
| [Getting started](../harness/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) | A guided tour in 45 minutes with the real output of every command: example project, generate, read problems, export, fill in values, release |
| [Learning path](../harness/docs/LEARNING_PATH.md) | The whole route in nine steps, each with an example and a "done when" |
| [Concepts](../harness/docs/CONCEPTS.md) | The words and the mental model, in ten minutes |

## User guides

| Page | What it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| [User manual](../harness/docs/user-manual/README.md) | One page per task: draw the design, generate harnesses, read and fix problems, fill in engineering values, import data, import KiCad pinouts, export outputs, set wire colours, release a harness, use Git and CI |
| [How-to index](../harness/docs/HOWTO.md) | The old list of recipes, now pointing at the user manual |
| [User guide](../harness/docs/guide/USER_GUIDE.md) | The guide that opens with **F1** in the app: screen, modes, menus, shortcuts |
| [Tips](../harness/docs/TIPS.md) | Shortcuts, power-user workflows, and what can and cannot be exchanged with other tools |
| [Cheat sheet](../harness/docs/CHEATSHEET.md) | One page: the loop, the data imports, release, shortcuts, the folder layout |

| [Configuration](../harness/docs/CONFIG.md) | Every key of `config/*.json` |
| [Placeholders](../harness/docs/PLACEHOLDERS.md) | Which engineering values are still placeholders and who owns them |
| [Imports](../harness/docs/IMPORTS.md) | Importing interfaces, parts, lengths and engineering values |
| [KiCad](../harness/docs/KICAD.md) | Taking unit connector pinouts from a KiCad netlist |

### Where is the page for …?

| You looked for | It is |
| --- | --- |
| `getting-started.md` | [`harness/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](../harness/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) |
| `faq.md` | [`harness/docs/FAQ.md`](../harness/docs/FAQ.md) |
| `troubleshooting.md` | [`harness/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](../harness/docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) |
| `glossary.md` | [`harness/docs/GLOSSARY.md`](../harness/docs/GLOSSARY.md) |
| `tips.md` | [`harness/docs/TIPS.md`](../harness/docs/TIPS.md) |
| `user-manual/` | [`harness/docs/user-manual/`](../harness/docs/user-manual/README.md) |
| `examples/` | [`harness/docs/examples/`](../harness/docs/examples/README.md) |
| `developer/` | [`harness/docs/developer/`](../harness/docs/developer/README.md) |

The tool's pages use upper-case names (`FAQ.md`) in `harness/docs/` because that is the style they already had and because tests check those names.

Next: [Install](../harness/docs/INSTALL.md).
